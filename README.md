Tool for generating pictures using mathematical formulas.

### Algorithm

* Generate name

This app has image checker

### Samples

There is samples folder with some nice images in text-format. You can use app's read file option to convert these texts into images.

### Building

Use Cython to prebuild binary libraries.

### Usage

### Thanks

I'd like to thank:

Andrej Bauer for wonderful online random art project (http://www.random-art.org/online/), original Python randomart code (http://math.andrej.com/2010/04/21/random-art-in-python/) and great ideas which lead to this project.

Matt DesLauriers for cool color-wander project (http://color-wander.surge.sh/) and (https://github.com/mattdesl/color-wander) and nice palettes used in this project.

Volodymyr Shymanskyy for his JS randomart project (https://github.com/vshymanskyy/randomart) that gave me some ideas such as mindepth and some operators.

Halvor Kjærås for random art generator - (http://ironigardinen.net/generatorer/art2/index.html). It gave me some ideas and data for MathArtist art name generator.
