### Algorithm

* ANN generates name
* ANN generates palette
* Draw: select instruments and use them
* ANN rates generated image and maybe tell program to redraw it (?)
* Post-processing (filters, noise etc)
* Create image file
* Post in Instagram and twitter as human

### Instruments

* functions from randomart.py
* some more math and other functions (maybe generate them)
* particles (color, size, velocity, maybe use some pregenerated contours for trajectories, or maybe let ANN generate these paths)
